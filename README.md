#Assembler Project for Elements of Computing System hack computer

The machine code this generates is not for regular computers but for the hack computer built in elements of computing systems.
I also built that computer using the hardware simulator. 

If you want to run this program:
1. Put the .asm file in the same place as the assem executable file.
2. Then call assem "yourasmfile.asm"
3. The resulting assembly code will be generated for the hack computer.

This program has been tested by comparing the actual machine code for the .asm that are currently present in the folder.
   
This is what the CPU if the hack computer looks like:

These are its instructions:
